# Spike: chaochao as a Discord Activity

**Date:** 2026-06-20 · **Branch:** `worktree-discord-activity-spike` · **Status:** Phases 0–2 + **Phase 4 LIVE-VERIFIED** — a real match connects and ticks, AND a real Discord user is identified in-frame, bridged to a Supabase account, and defaults to their Discord-avatar skin (desktop, cloudflared tunnel, app `ChaoChao Dev` id `1509768531686723748`). See "Live bring-up results" (Phase 0–2) and "Phase 4 live results" below.

## Question

Can chaochao ship as a [Discord Activity](https://docs.discord.com/developers/activities/overview) (an embedded-iframe app using the Embedded App SDK), reusing the existing authoritative Socket.IO server, on desktop **and** mobile Discord clients?

## Verdict

**Yes — strong candidate, ~70% there.** The engine, networking model, responsive canvas, touch controls, and auth provider already fit. The gap is Discord-specific glue (Embedded App SDK + `/token` exchange, `/.proxy/` URL-mapping discipline, two CDN deps to vendor/proxy) plus two policy items for a *public* listing (Privacy Policy + ToS). Nothing structural blocks it.

---

## Audit findings (codebase vs. Discord requirements)

| # | Area | Verdict | Evidence / note |
|---|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Embedding | needs-work | `index.js` CSP `frame-ancestors` lacked Discord origins (**fixed in this spike**). `client/scripts/embed.js` `isEmbedded()` (`window.self !== window.top`) already fires inside any iframe and trims chrome — reusable. |
| 2 | Networking | compatible (test WS) | Same-origin `io()` (`client/scripts/client.js`), no hardcoded server origin. WS upgrade **and** the long-polling fallback must route through `/.proxy/` — verify against the live tunnel. |
| 3 | Assets | needs-work | Game assets are relative (good). External CDNs in `play.html`: jQuery (googleapis) + Bootstrap CSS (bootstrapcdn) are **hard deps**; supabase-js + simple-keyboard (jsdelivr), gtag, gamemonetize ad SDK. Each non-Discord host needs a URL mapping or local vendoring or it fails `blocked:csp`. `cdn.discordapp.com` is exempt. |
| 4 | Auth | compatible model / needs in-frame flow | Supabase OAuth already supports **Discord** as a provider + guest fallback (`client/scripts/auth.js`); `cdn.discordapp.com` avatars allowlisted (`server/messenger.js`). But the current flow is a full-page redirect, which breaks in an iframe — replace with the SDK `authorize → /token (server) → authenticate` flow. |
| 5 | Hosting/HTTPS | compatible | Heroku terminates TLS; app speaks HTTP behind it; port is config/`PORT`-driven. Discord just needs a public HTTPS URL to map. |
| 6 | Mobile/touch | compatible | Mobile viewport + `viewport-fit=cover` (`play.html`), on-screen joystick/buttons (`input.js`, `joystick.js`). Add Discord safe-area insets when mobile is enabled. |
| 7 | Sizing | compatible | `game.js resize()` fits canvas to its **container** (not `window`) at uniform 16:9 with DPR cap — exactly right for Discord's variable iframe. Re-check the `innerWidth<900` perf-tier demotion under embed dimensions. |
| 8 | Analytics/3rd-party | needs-work | gtag/GA4 + ad SDK degrade to no-ops (safe) but should be gated off when embedded to avoid `blocked:csp` noise; Discord disallows third-party ad networks anyway. |

---

## Key technical findings (the real integration wrinkles)

1. **`/.proxy/` is the whole game.** All traffic is forced through `https://<APPLICATION_ID>.discordsays.com`; any request to a non-mapped external host fails with `blocked:csp`. Relative requests must be prefixed `/.proxy/`. The SDK's `patchUrlMappings()` monkey-patches `fetch`/`WebSocket`/`XMLHttpRequest.open` so dev (un-sandboxed) and prod (sandboxed) behave the same — **use it, always-`.proxy/`**.

2. **Bundle-model mismatch.** chaochao's `build.js` uses esbuild `transform` on *concatenated global-sharing scripts* — it does **not** resolve `node_modules` imports. The Embedded App SDK is an ESM npm package. So the Discord entry needs a real esbuild `build()` step (bundle + IIFE) separate from the existing concat path. This spike adds that step for `discord.bundle.min.js` and proves the SDK bundles.

3. **Separate entry, not a `play.html` retrofit.** A 4th entry (`discord.html` → `discord.bundle.min.js`) keeps the Discord SDK/auth out of the web + portal builds entirely. The harness initializes the SDK, then hands off to the existing game.

4. **Token exchange stays server-side.** Client secret never enters the bundle; add `POST /.proxy/api/token` on the existing Express server (Phase 4).

5. **WebRTC is blocked** in the sandbox — irrelevant to chaochao (Socket.IO/WebSocket only), but noted.

---

## Live bring-up results (Phase 0–2, verified 2026-06-20 desktop)

A real chaochao match connects and **ticks** inside the Discord Activity iframe on
desktop (Socket.IO over `/.proxy/` — `GAME …`, ~21 ms ping, terrain/stations/boons
rendering, round timer running). Socket.IO over the proxy needed **no** transport
change — the existing `["websocket","polling"]` + `tryAllTransports` config just
works. The actual blockers were elsewhere; five fixes landed on this branch:

1. **jQuery is a hard boot dep, and the sandbox CSP-blocks external `<script src>`.**
   `game.js` wraps its whole boot in `$(function(){…})`, so with jQuery's googleapis
   CDN blocked the page threw before connecting. `patchUrlMappings()` only reroutes
   fetch/WS/XHR, **not** parser-loaded `<script>`/`<link>`. Fix: vendor jQuery 3.5.1 +
   Bootstrap 4.1.3 under `client/vendor/`; the Discord handoff loads `play.html?discord=1`
   and the server swaps those two CDN tags for the local copies + drops the gtag loader
   for that request only (web build byte-identical). *(commit `a567025`)*
2. **Discord loads the Activity at the mapped ROOT `/`**, which served the marketing
   landing page, not the SDK bootstrap. The Discord client always appends launch params
   (`frame_id` is required by the SDK), so serve `discord.html` at `/` when `frame_id` is
   present; plain web `/` still gets the landing page. *(commit `525756b`)*
3. **Iframe keyboard focus.** All key/mouse handlers bind on `window`, which only gets
   keyboard events while the frame holds focus — so clicking Discord's chat stole WASD,
   and the first click back into the cross-origin frame was eaten focusing it (making DOM
   controls look dead). Fix: reclaim focus via `window.focus()` on pointer/touch when
   `isEmbedded()` (also benefits the CrazyGames/Poki/itch embeds). *(commit `3e13a57`)*
4. **AFK kick / leave navigated to `index.html`** — a dead end in-frame (its links lack
   `?discord=1`). Re-enter a fresh game (`play.html?discord=1`) in the Activity context
   instead. *(commit `1993e4b`)*
5. **Inline `on*=""` handlers don't fire in the sandbox.** The emoji wheel's close-X and
   emoji-send used inline `onclick=`; only real `addEventListener` handlers run in-frame
   (which is why right-click closed but left-click didn't). Replaced with one delegated
   `addEventListener` on `#emojiMenu` (`data-emoji-close` marks the X). This was the only
   inline handler in `play.html`. *(commit `2c8d98c`)*

**Operator setup that worked:** reused the existing OAuth app `ChaoChao Dev`; Activities
can't be enabled until a URL Mapping exists, so the order is tunnel-first → set Root
Mapping `/` → `<tunnel-host>` → enable Activities. `cloudflared tunnel --url
http://localhost:3000` (no account); `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` set in the server env;
`DISCORD_MAPPING_TARGET` left unset (same-origin is correct for a root mapping). Quick
tunnels are ephemeral — the URL changes on restart and must be re-pasted into the mapping.

**Known follow-ups surfaced in-frame (not blockers):** AFK re-entry loops while idle (a
proper fix suppresses the AFK kick in Activities or shows an in-frame "click to rejoin"
panel); "Leave" can't truly exit (Discord closes the Activity via its own UI); the
`discord.html → play.html` redirect drops the SDK instance, so Phase 4/5 (auth/presence)
will want the game hosted in the Activity frame (or the SDK re-init'd) rather than redirected.

## Phase 4 live results (in-frame auth, verified 2026-06-20 desktop)

A real Discord user (`roknua`) signs in **inside the Activity** — no full-page OAuth
redirect — is bridged to a real Supabase user, and the game recognises them (log:
`exchange OK -> handshake token minted` → `socket … resolved to user <uuid>`). Their
Discord picture is their default kart skin. The shipped design + the fixes the live
bring-up forced:

**Auth-bridge decision (operator-resolved): server-minted ticket + identity-match.**
- `POST /api/token` (`server/discordAuth.js`, owns `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`) exchanges the
  `authorize()` code, RE-VALIDATES via Discord `/users/@me` (never trusts SDK-supplied
  user data), then bridges to Supabase: `findOrCreateDiscordUser()` matches the validated
  snowflake to an existing account (web "Continue with Discord" OR a prior Activity launch)
  so unlocks carry over, else admin-creates + links one. Two-way unification via a
  SECURITY DEFINER migration (`find_user_by_discord_id` / `link_discord_identity`,
  service_role only) — applied + e2e-verified against the dev DB.
- **No shared HS256 secret exists** — the project signs with asymmetric keys
  (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is blank; the server runs `network verify`). So we can't mint a
  "real" Supabase token. Instead the bridge mints OUR OWN session ticket (HS256 with a
  server-only secret derived from the service-role key — stable across restarts, no new
  env var), and `verifyToken()` accepts it (issuer `chaochao-activity`) BEFORE the
  Supabase paths. The handshake then treats a Discord player exactly like a web player.
- **No client-side supabase-js in-frame** — the bridge is entirely server-side, so the
  leftover Phase 3 supabase-js vendoring is NOT needed for auth.

**The SDK-instance-drop:** auth runs in `discord.html` (where the SDK lives) and stashes
the minted ticket + validated profile in `sessionStorage` BEFORE the existing redirect to
`play.html?discord=1`; `auth.js` reads the stash and drives the socket handshake +
profile. (Hosting the game in-frame / re-init'ing the SDK was the heavier alt; deferred.)

**The blocker that ate ~5 relaunches — `patchUrlMappings`.** The in-frame `fetch('/api/token')`
silently never left the frame (guest fallback). Root cause: `discordActivity.js` called
`patchUrlMappings([{prefix:'/', target:''}])`, which monkey-patches fetch/XHR to rewrite
EVERY same-origin URL — with a root prefix + empty target the rewrite was malformed. The
Activity's **root URL Mapping already proxies all same-origin paths** (that's why the
game's Socket.IO on play.html, which never patches, connects fine), so `patchUrlMappings`
was both unnecessary and breaking. **Removed it; same-origin requests use plain relative
paths and ride the root mapping.** (For mapping EXTERNAL hosts it'd still be the tool.)

**Cache-busting was essential to even debug this:** Discord's sandbox caches in-frame JS
hard despite `no-cache`, and the bundle/script filenames are stable, so fixes appeared not
to take. The server now stamps the `discord.bundle` URL with its mtime and every in-frame
`play.html` script src with the server-boot id (both only for the Activity requests).

**Scopes:** `authorize({ identify, rpc.activities.write, guilds, rpc.voice.read })` —
`rpc.voice.read` wired now so Phase 5b lights up without re-consent.

**`rpc.voice.read` note:** the app owner consented fine in dev; confirm it's permitted
before relying on it for non-dev users (Phase 5b degrades silently if denied).

## Implementation plan (9 phases; ~7–8 dev-days to testable, +~1d voice-activity delighter, +listing prereqs & ~2–3d skin shop for public/monetized)

### Phase 0 — Portal & dev harness *(operator-gated; ~0.5d)*
Create the Discord app, enable **Activities**, set **URL Mappings** (root `/` → tunnel host), stand up a `cloudflared`/`ngrok` tunnel to local `:3000`. See the operator recipe below.

### Phase 1 — Entry bundle + SDK bootstrap *(~1d)* — **scaffolded in this spike**
`client/discord.html` + `client/scripts/discordActivity.js` (ESM): init handshake (init → READY), `patchUrlMappings()` early, set an `isDiscord` flag, then hand off to the game. New `discord.bundle.min.js` esbuild `build()` step in `build.js`; served + prod-rewritten via `index.js`.

### Phase 2 — CSP + networking through the proxy *(~1d)* — **CSP done in this spike**
`frame-ancestors` Discord origins (**done**). Verify Socket.IO WS upgrade + polling fallback over `/.proxy/`; confirm `contentDelivery` manifests resolve; cookies (if any) `SameSite=None; Partitioned` on `discordsays.com`.

### Phase 3 — External deps: vendor/gate *(~1d)*
Vendor jQuery + Bootstrap for the Discord build (hard deps); map/vendor supabase-js + simple-keyboard; gate gtag + ad SDK off when `isDiscord`.

### Phase 4 — In-frame auth + token exchange *(~1.5d)* — **DONE, LIVE-VERIFIED**
`POST /api/token` (client secret server-side) → `authorize` → `authenticate` → bridge to a real Supabase user via a server-minted session ticket so cosmetics/progression work unchanged. Re-validate identity server-side. See "Phase 4 live results" above for the as-built design + the `patchUrlMappings` fix.

### Phase 5 — Multiplayer/presence reconciliation *(~1–1.5d)*
Scope rooms by Discord `instanceId`; subscribe `getInstanceConnectedParticipants()` + `ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE`; map onto the `hostess`/`Room` model so a voice group lands in one room. Anonymize identity by default for cross-server matchmaking.

### Phase 5b — Voice-activity visual (Discord-only delighter) *(~1d; depends on Phase 4 scope + Phase 5 presence)*
Show who's talking, in-game — the touch that makes the Activity feel genuinely Discord-native. The SDK emits `SPEAKING_START` / `SPEAKING_STOP` (payload `{channel_id, user_id}`) for the subscribed voice channel.

- **Scope:** add `rpc.voice.read` to the `authorize()` scopes (wire in Phase 4).
- **Subscribe:** after auth, get the voice channel id (`sdk.channelId`) and `sdk.subscribe('SPEAKING_START', {channel_id}, …)` / `'SPEAKING_STOP'`.
- **Map:** Discord `user_id` → in-game kart via the Phase 5 participant↔player mapping; toggle an `isSpeaking` flag per player (server-broadcast so all clients render it, or client-local if the indicator is only for the local view).
- **Render (two surfaces, like other Discord Activities):** (a) a speaking indicator **on the kart** — reuse an existing draw path (a pulsing underglow ring like the team glow, or a small mic glyph above the kart in `draw.js` / `draw_skins.js`); and (b) an optional **voice tray** — a small row of participant avatars (`cdn.discordapp.com`, already allowlisted) that highlight the active speaker. Both gate on `isDiscord`; web/portal builds unaffected.
- **Caveat:** events fire only for the subscribed channel and need scope consent — degrade silently if denied. Confirm `SPEAKING_*` is exposed by the current SDK during build (historically gated; supported for Activities now, but verify).

### Phase 6 — Mobile polish *(~1d; mobile enabled per operator choice)*
Enable mobile in the portal; wire `--discord-safe-area-inset-*` (with `env()` fallback); re-check `innerWidth<900` Auto perf demotion under embed dims; optional thermal-state subscription → degrade rendering (chaochao already has perf tiers).

### Phase 7 — Listing prerequisites *(non-code; public-only)*
Publish **Privacy Policy + ToS** (neither exists today — hard blocker for Discovery); app **verification** → fill Discovery settings → Enable Discovery; confirm content-policy compliance. No allowlist/partner gating remains.

### Phase 8 — Skin shop (in-app purchases) *(~2–3d; depends on Phase 4)*
Monetize cosmetics via Discord's Embedded App SDK IAP — the blessed model, a clean fit for the planned purchasable-skin catalogue (chaochao's native unlocks stay **gameplay rewards**; bought skins are a separate paid layer).

- **Eligibility (operator, gating):** Enable Monetization for the app (verification + team/payout setup + age/region requirements — a stricter gate than running an Activity). Confirm the current revenue share when enabling — reported ~10% to Discord (you keep ~90%), but sources vary up to 30%, so verify.
- **SKUs:** each purchasable skin = one **DURABLE** SKU (permanent entitlement). Reserve **CONSUMABLE** for any repeatable buys (none planned). Create SKUs in the portal (publish "Store and the API" or "API Only").
- **Storefront:** build the shop UI inside the Activity (reuse the existing skin-hub/preview rendering — `skinRegistry.js`, recap/preview paths). List SKUs; on select call `discordSdk.commands.startPurchase(skuId)`.
- **Grant flow:** subscribe to `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE`; **verify the entitlement server-side** via Discord's HTTP API ("trust the SDK, verify via API"), then write the unlock into the existing cosmetic-ownership store. The Discord entitlement → an unlock record for that player.
- **Identity dependency:** entitlements exist only for Discord-authed players → requires Phase 4 (Discord token → Supabase session) so there's an account to attach ownership to. Honour [[cosmetic-persistence-invariant]]: signed-in = server-DB authoritative; never mirror paid unlocks through guest localStorage.
- **Design guardrails:** prefer **Discord-exclusive** cosmetics over selling XP-unlockable skins (avoids pay-to-skip devaluing progression). Keep paid items purely cosmetic — no gameplay advantage.
- **Caveat:** Activities are an additive revenue surface (thousands–tens-of-thousands of plays), not a primary funnel — size expectations accordingly.

> **Advertising is NOT a Discord monetization path.** Third-party ad SDKs (chaochao's `ads.js` / gamemonetize) are CSP-blocked in the sandbox *and* off-policy; the only platform ad surface is Discord-run **Quests** (opt-in, Discord-controlled, not a dev lever). Gate ads off when `isDiscord` (Phase 3) and treat in-Activity ad revenue as zero. The skin shop is the monetization strategy for this build.

## Operator test recipe (Phase 0, needed to verify the scaffold live)

The scaffold can't be verified headlessly — it needs a real Discord app + a public tunnel. Steps:

1. **Create the app:** https://discord.com/developers/applications → New Application. Note `APPLICATION_ID` and (Settings → OAuth2) the **Client Secret**.
2. **Enable Activities:** app → **Activities** → toggle on (auto-creates a Launch entry point).
3. **URL Mappings:** app → Activities → URL Mappings → add root `/` → `<your-tunnel-host>` (bare host, no `https://`).
4. **Tunnel to local:**
   ```bash
   # terminal 1 — the game (worktree)
   cd /Users/sdodge/Documents/Projects/chaochao/.claude/worktrees/discord-activity-spike
   npm install && npm run build && PORT=3000 node index.js
   # terminal 2 — public HTTPS tunnel
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000   # or: ngrok http 3000
   ```
   Put the tunnel's host in the URL Mapping (step 3). The Activity entry URL is `discord.html`.
5. **Launch in Discord:** Developer Mode on → join a voice channel → Activities → your app (in-development apps appear for the dev). Open devtools in the Activity frame.
6. **What to confirm:** frame loads (no CSP block — the `frame-ancestors` fix), `discordActivity.js` logs the READY handshake, and a match **connects + ticks** (Socket.IO over `/.proxy/`). That last point is the spike's core de-risking goal.

---

## Open decisions for the operator

- **Auth bridge (Phase 4):** ✅ RESOLVED — server-minted session ticket + identity-match (see "Phase 4 live results"). The FK from `progression` to `auth.users` forces a real Supabase user either way; matching the Discord snowflake carries existing web unlocks over. No client-side supabase-js, no dashboard wiring.
- **Vendor vs. map (Phase 3):** vendor jQuery/Bootstrap locally (simplest, larger bundle) or add URL mappings (keeps CDNs). Recommend vendoring for the Discord build.
- **Public listing:** decide whether/when to invest in Privacy Policy + ToS + verification.
- **Skin shop (Phase 8):** Discord-exclusive cosmetics vs. selling XP-unlockable skins (recommend exclusive); confirm the live revenue share at monetization-enable time.

## Follow-up prompt (operator-injectable)

> Continue the Discord Activity work from `docs/spikes/discord-activity.md`. Phase 0–2 scaffold is on `worktree-discord-activity-spike` (CSP origins added, `discord.html` + `discordActivity.js` SDK bootstrap, `discord.bundle.min.js` build step). I've created the Discord app (APPLICATION_ID=…, secret in env) and a tunnel; the frame loads and the READY handshake fires. Next: (1) verify/fix Socket.IO WS+polling over `/.proxy/` so a match ticks, then (2) implement Phase 3 (vendor jQuery+Bootstrap, gate gtag/ads off when isDiscord) and Phase 4 (`POST /.proxy/api/token` + authorize/authenticate bridged to a Supabase session). Mobile + desktop target — keep Phase 6 in scope.
